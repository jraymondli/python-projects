Your solution is correct and meets the requirements of \(O(n)\) time complexity without using division. You’ve implemented a clear, two-pass approach with `left` and `right` arrays to store cumulative products, which makes it easy to understand. Here are a few feedback points and suggestions for slight improvements:

### Feedback and Suggested Improvements

1. **Optimize Space Usage**: Currently, you use two extra arrays, `left` and `right`, each of size \(n\). This approach can be optimized to use \(O(1)\) additional space (ignoring the output array `res`) by calculating the product in a single pass through `nums`.

2. **Combine Left and Right Passes in `res` Array**: Instead of using `left` and `right` arrays, use `res` to store cumulative products. First, store left products in `res`, then update `res` by incorporating right products in a second pass.

3. **Code Simplification**: This reduces memory usage and simplifies the code while retaining clarity.

Here’s the optimized version with comments:

```python
def product_except_self(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    res = [1] * n  # Initialize result array with 1's

    # First pass: Calculate left products for each index and store in `res`
    for i in range(1, n):
        res[i] = nums[i - 1] * res[i - 1]
    
    # Second pass: Multiply by right products for each index directly in `res`
    right = 1  # Initialize right product as 1
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        res[i] *= right
        right *= nums[i]
    
    return res
```

### Explanation of the Optimized Solution

1. **First Pass**: Populate `res` with left cumulative products (products of elements to the left of each index).
2. **Second Pass**: Use a `right` variable to accumulate the right product as you iterate from the end of `nums`, updating each `res[i]` with the product of left and right elements.

### Benefits of the Optimized Solution

- **Space Efficiency**: Uses only one array (`res`) to store the result, along with a single `right` variable.
- **Simplicity**: Reduces code complexity by eliminating the need for two extra arrays.

This optimized approach achieves the same result but with improved space complexity, keeping the time complexity at \(O(n)\).
