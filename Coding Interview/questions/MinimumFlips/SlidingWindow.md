Certainly! To solve this problem in \( O(n) \) time, we can optimize by avoiding explicit rotations. Instead, we can count the minimum flips needed directly by comparing two patterns across the entire string. Here's how:

### Optimized Approach
1. **Precompute Patterns**: We still consider the two possible alternating patterns ("0101..." and "1010...") for the given length of \( s \).
2. **Sliding Window Technique**: Instead of rotating \( s \), we can treat the string as if it were infinite by simulating rotations with a sliding window approach.
3. **Track Differences**: We track how many characters differ from each pattern within a sliding window of length \( n \). As we slide the window, we can efficiently adjust the count of differences.

### Implementation
Here's the Python code using this optimized approach:

```python
def min_operations_to_alternate(s: str) -> int:
    n = len(s)
    
    # Construct the two possible alternating patterns for length 2 * n
    alt1 = ''.join(['0' if i % 2 == 0 else '1' for i in range(2 * n)])
    alt2 = ''.join(['1' if i % 2 == 0 else '0' for i in range(2 * n)])
    
    # Double the string to simulate rotations without actually rotating
    s = s * 2
    
    # Initialize minimum flips required to a large number
    min_flips = float('inf')
    
    # Count the initial differences for the first window of length n
    diff1 = sum(1 for i in range(n) if s[i] != alt1[i])
    diff2 = sum(1 for i in range(n) if s[i] != alt2[i])
    
    # Slide the window across the double-length string
    for i in range(n):
        # Update the minimum flips found
        min_flips = min(min_flips, diff1, diff2)
        
        # Slide the window by removing the effect of the outgoing element and adding the incoming element
        if s[i] != alt1[i]: diff1 -= 1
        if s[i + n] != alt1[i + n]: diff1 += 1
        
        if s[i] != alt2[i]: diff2 -= 1
        if s[i + n] != alt2[i + n]: diff2 += 1
    
    # Ensure to take the minimum after the last window
    min_flips = min(min_flips, diff1, diff2)
    
    return min_flips
```

### Explanation
1. **Double the String**: By doubling \( s \), we simulate all rotations without actually rotating the string.
2. **Initialize Counts**: We compute the initial number of differences between the first \( n \) characters of \( s \) and both alternating patterns.
3. **Sliding Window Update**: As we slide over the doubled string, we adjust the difference counts by:
   - Removing the effect of the outgoing character.
   - Adding the effect of the incoming character in the window.
4. **Track Minimum Flips**: Throughout the sliding window process, we keep track of the minimum flips needed.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \) because we only pass through the string twice.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(n) \) for storing the doubled string and the alternating patterns.

This approach efficiently finds the minimum Type-2 operations required to make the string alternating.
