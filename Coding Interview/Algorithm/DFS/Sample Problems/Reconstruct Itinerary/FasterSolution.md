Your solution, while functional, can be improved in efficiency, particularly for cases involving loops and dense graphs. Below are suggestions to optimize your solution:

### Key Optimization Ideas:

1. **Eulerian Path**:
   - This problem can be mapped to finding an Eulerian path in a directed graph. Since the input guarantees at least one valid itinerary, you can leverage Hierholzer's algorithm for efficient traversal.

2. **Iterative DFS**:
   - Replace the recursive DFS with an iterative DFS to avoid stack overhead and improve control over the search process.

3. **In-Place Modification**:
   - Use in-place sorting of adjacency lists and pop destinations as you traverse them to reduce redundant iterations.

4. **Backtracking Reduction**:
   - By leveraging the properties of the Eulerian path, you can construct the result in reverse order and avoid heavy backtracking.

### Optimized Code
Here is the refactored version of your code with the above optimizations:

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

class Solution:
    def findItinerary(self, tickets: List[List[str]]) -> List[str]:
        # Create adjacency list
        adj = defaultdict(list)
        for src, dst in tickets:
            adj[src].append(dst)

        # Sort destinations for lexical order
        for src in adj:
            adj[src].sort(reverse=True)  # Reverse sort to pop from the end efficiently
        
        # Stack for iterative DFS and result list
        stack = ["JFK"]
        result = deque()  # Use deque for efficient appends on both ends

        # Perform Hierholzer's algorithm
        while stack:
            while adj[stack[-1]]:
                # Push the next destination
                stack.append(adj[stack[-1]].pop())
            # Add to result once we exhaust destinations from current airport
            result.appendleft(stack.pop())
        
        return list(result)
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Reverse Sorting**:
   - Sorting the adjacency list in reverse order ensures you can efficiently `pop()` the smallest lexical destination from the back of the list.

2. **Hierholzerâ€™s Algorithm**:
   - Instead of backtracking, we keep exploring until we reach a "dead end" (no more outgoing edges). At that point, we add the node to the result.

3. **Iterative DFS**:
   - Using a stack for DFS avoids recursion overhead and improves control over the traversal process.

4. **Efficient Result Construction**:
   - The result is built in reverse order using a `deque` for O(1) operations at both ends.

### Why is This Faster?
- **Time Complexity**: Sorting the adjacency lists takes \(O(E \log E)\), and traversing all edges is \(O(E)\), where \(E\) is the number of tickets. Overall, the complexity is \(O(E \log E)\), which is efficient.
- **Space Complexity**: The space is \(O(V + E)\), where \(V\) is the number of airports (nodes).

This optimized solution should handle test cases with loops and dense graphs efficiently.
