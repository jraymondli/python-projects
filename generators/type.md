The type annotation `Generator[str, None, None]` is used to describe Python generator functions and it gives specific information about three things: the type of values the generator yields, the type it can accept when `send()` is used, and the type it returns when it finishes execution.

Here's what each part means in detail:

1. **`str` (First Argument):**  
   This indicates the type of values the generator will yield. In your case, the generator yields strings. When using a `yield` statement inside the generator function, the type of value that comes out is a string.

2. **`None` (Second Argument):**  
   This represents the type of values that the generator can accept if you send values into it using the `.send()` method. In this case, `None` means that the generator is not designed to accept any values via `.send()`. If your generator accepted values via `.send()`, this argument would represent the type of those values.

3. **`None` (Third Argument):**  
   This describes the return type of the generator function when it is done (i.e., when `StopIteration` is raised). Since generator functions don't typically return a meaningful value after they complete execution, this is `None`. However, if a generator function does return a value explicitly at the end, that would be reflected here.

### Example Breakdown:

Consider the function `chunk_stream` with the type `Generator[str, None, None]`:

```python
def chunk_stream(text_stream: Generator[str, None, None], stop_token: str) -> Generator[str, None, None]:
    # function body
```

- **Yields:** The generator yields `str` values when you iterate over it, for example:
  ```python
  for chunk in chunk_stream(...):  # chunk will be of type `str`
      print(chunk)
  ```
  
- **Sends:** This generator does not accept any values via `.send()`, so the second `None` indicates that.

- **Returns:** When the generator function is done, it doesn’t return any specific value, hence the third `None`.

### Alternative Example with `send()` and return type:

If a generator accepted values with `send()` and returned a value at the end, the signature would change. For example:

```python
def example_generator() -> Generator[int, str, float]:
    received_value = yield 10  # Yields an integer
    print(f"Received: {received_value}")  # This value can be sent in via `.send()`
    return 3.14  # When the generator completes, it returns a float
```

In this case:
- `int`: The generator yields integers (`yield 10`).
- `str`: The generator can accept strings via `.send()` (`received_value` will hold the sent value).
- `float`: The generator returns a float when it terminates (`return 3.14`).

### To summarize:
- `Generator[str, None, None]`: The generator yields `str` values, doesn’t accept anything via `.send()`, and doesn’t return a value when it completes.

Let me know if this clears up the explanation!
